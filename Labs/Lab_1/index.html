<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<!--
This is the start of our web page.

Here we define our <html> and </html> tags, and between that we will
place everything else, including our 'head' and our 'body' along with
some bootstrapping 'javascript code' or some css.

eg:
we start out with

<html>
	...
	...
</html>

and lay that out.

and progress to adding the HEAD and BODY sections

<html>
	<head>
	..define some stuff in head...
	</head>

	<body>
	 ...define some stuff in body
	</body>
	...other stuff maybe
</html>

and once that is done  from there to

<html>
	<head>
	..define some stuff in head...
	</head>

	<body>
	...define some stuff in body
	  [script]
	  ...write most of our javascript code...
	  [/script]
	</body>
	...other stuff maybe
</html>


And at that point we have a clear defination for

	HTML Page
			Title
			Body
			..Code

To keep things nice and clean, the web page will be broken up into a number of parts

	HTML Files will 'mostly' contain HTML and some javascript
	JS files will contain all our 'functions' that do stuff.
	CSS files will contain all the data that makes our site 'look' the way it does.
-->




<!-- IT BEGINS!!!! -->
<html>

<!-- The first thing we will do inside of our HTML page is to define the HEAD
of the web page. It has some useful stuff we can set so that's what we're going
to do.
-->
	<head>
		<!--
		Our Page Title (that appears in the titlebar of your browser), search results
		and else where. You need to set this.

		NOTE: The <title> element defines the title of the document, and is required in all
		HTML/XHTML documents.

		See: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_head.asp if you need more info
		-->
		<title>Cornerstone Student Network</title>


		<!--
		Another useful, but optional element is 'description', which lets us add some additional
		information to our web page that tends to turn up in search engines, web crawlers
		and other users who might pull your web page will apprciate it if you use it

		<description>
				The Cornerstone Student Network is a HTML5,CSS3 and JS website built by cornerstone Students
		</description>
		-->

		<!--
		Speaking of search engines! - lets provide some keywords so search engines
		can direct users to our site more easily, an important skill in SEO & Marketing!
		-->
		<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JS, JavaScript, Cornerstone, Students, Network, Showpiece">

		<!-- Lets define the 'Author' of the page, because its good to get recognician! -->
		<meta name="author" content="Ivan Malone">


		<!--The Character set we are going to use-->
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<!--If you need a refresher on character sets: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_charset.asp -->

		<!--
		NOTE: How was it I knew to use things like 'keywords', 'author', 'description' and so on?

		Some things are required, some are optional. You can explore more about HTML Head tags here
		https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_head.asp
		-->


		<!-- lETS CONTINUE! We got a website to build!

		HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the 'viewport', through the <meta> tag.
		The viewport is the 'users' "visible" are of the web page. The viewport properties vary with device, window resize
		and will be smaller on mobiles than on computer screens.

		NOTE: You should include the following <meta> viewport element in all your web pages:

			 <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

	  A <meta> viewport element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling
		but also provides valuable information for your code too.

		NOTE: To find out more about the 'viewport' check out https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp

		So, for our needs, we set a 'viewport' that is the width of device, scaled to 1, and not user scalable
	  -->
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no" />

		<!-- Now, lets deal with the CSS parts

		Since we are going to create a beautiful looking site and we want to keep our code tidy, we will keep the vast majority
		of all our CSS styling stuff in a 'main.css' file.

		NOTE: Need a refresher on CSS? Check out https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp

		So, now we set what our main stylesheet is.

		I have provided a complex stylesheet that contains both CSS and JS parts.
		-->
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/main.css" />

		<!-- NOTE: Need some info on meta tags? see https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp -->


		<!--NOTE: Since not all browsers can run the javascript in the CSS I provided, we must provide an alternative one!

		There are many situations when a user 'may' or 'may not' have javascript enabled in their browser, since this is a common
		thing to happen - we handle this situation. We do this by using a common 3rd party CSS called noscript.css which
		takes care of some stuff for us. In the case where no javascript is detected, we simply 'replace' our stylesheet that we
		just set in the previous statement, with the no one we set during our <noscript> tag as you will see.

		In order to use the noscript.css I use the 'noscript' tag  to define an alternate content for users that have disabled
		scripts in their browser, and using link rel and href

		NOTE: What is noscript? - its just a handy script I provide for us to use for this case, at this moment we just
		include it but dont need to know how it works, it just provides a nice clean css when javascript isn't enabled in
		a browser, you will 'often' use 3rd party libraries like this later in career.
	  -->

		<noscript>
			<!--Ok, in the case the browser has no javascript, it will look at this code, otherwise it will do nothing (most cases)

			the first thing we do is set up a relationship between the current document (our previous CSS which DOES use javascript, our main.css stylesheet)
		  and the noscript.css which provides basic css that contains no JavaScript.

					link rel="stylesheet"
					See: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_link_rel.asp for more information on that.

			this says set up a relationship with 'stylesheet' (remember we said in an earlier link rel that main.css was stylesheet), since this one useSectionTransitions
			javascript we need to 'replace it', before going any further with the web page loading. We use a hRef to reference it.

					href="assets/css/noscript.css" />
					See: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_href.asp
			 -->

			 <link rel="stylesheet"  href="assets/css/noscript.css" />
		<!-- We are finiahed handling code that should execute when no Javascript is detected -->
		</noscript>
		<!--If you want to learn about the NOSCRIPT tag, check out here: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_noscript.asp -->

		<!--
		Finished our Head finally!

		NOTE: Summary
		What have we learned here?
			* Its good to lay out your code nice first
			* We must *include* a title element on all html pages
			* You were introduced to the description element
			* We added some SEO friendly 'meta tags' to our page
			* We defined a character set we want to use 'utf8'
			* We setup a viewport which represents the 'users' view
			* We added a CSS file to take care of our styling
			* We added a 'handler' for the case where javascript is not supported
		-->
	</head>


<!--
Lets now start with the body
-->
	<body class="is-preload">
	<!--
	NOTE: In our main.css we defined a class for body called is-preload
	Search for 'body.is-preload' in main.css, this defines how our 'body'
	will look (and other elements too)
	-->

		When an 'item' in the nav menu is clicked, the page with automatically 'scoll' down the page to the relevent 'section' here.

		NOTE: The look, feel and behavior of the sections are governed by the code on main.css file. Where you a see a line like

				<section id="intro" class="main style1 dark fullscreen">

		it Means
			create the section called 'intro' and style it from 'main using style1, dark and fullscreen'

			main, sty1, dark and fullscreen all exist in the main.css, search for ".main {" (around line 2000+)

		Each section will have a different styling and behaviour. Only 1 section is commented as the rest follow the same pattern.
